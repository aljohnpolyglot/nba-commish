# NBA Commish — TODO (updated 2026-04-19, session 26)

## FEATURES — Backlog (low priority)

### Draft Scouting sidebar — mock-team projections + POT-weighted comparisons
DraftScouting tab in Team Office already has 70/30 value/fit scoring. Remaining for the **main sidebar** `DraftScoutingView`:
1. Show which team is projected at each slot (mock draft).
2. Weight POT for young players in player comparisons, not just current OVR.

### External-league roster repopulation at rollover
Nothing currently calls `generateProspect(..., 'Europe' | 'NBL' | 'G-League' | 'Endesa' | 'B-League')` at rollover to refill external-league rosters as players age out. Without this, Euroleague/NBL/etc. rosters shrink over long sims.

### Hall of Fame — tiered eligibility wait
Currently everyone waits the same 3 seasons regardless of first-ballot vs regular. Diff it: first-ballot = 1 year, regular = 3, borderline = 5.

- **Dead money / ghost contracts (Luol Deng rule)** — waived-player stretch across multiple years.
